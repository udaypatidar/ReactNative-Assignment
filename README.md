**About**

Created Signup and Login Page using React Native for users.

**Features**

List the key features your React Native app offers, corresponding to the assignment details:

- JavaScript code as the primary development language
- React Native framework for building native-looking mobile interfaces
- Navigation library (e.g., React Navigation) for seamless user flow management
- Redux for state management and data persistence
- Login and signup UI with robust validation to ensure secure data entry
- User Details List UI using FlatList for efficient scrolling and data rendering
- User details editing functionality for dynamic updates reflected in the homepage
- Storage of signup details in Redux for accessibility across app sessions (optional: consider adding integration with AsyncStorage or other persistent storage solutions)

**Installation**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current)
   - A code editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio)
   - For Android development: Android Studio with the Android SDK installed. See the setup guide: [https://developer.android.com/](https://developer.android.com/)
   - For iOS development: A Mac computer with Xcode installed. Download Xcode from the Mac App Store.

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-project-name>.git
   ```
   Replace `<your-username>` and `<your-project-name>` with your actual GitHub username and project name.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Navigate to your project directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

**Development**

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```
   This will start the Metro bundler, which watches for changes in your JavaScript code and reloads the app automatically.

2. **Run the app:**
   - **Android:**
     - Connect your Android device to your computer or use an emulator.
     - In your terminal, run:
       ```bash
       npx react-native run-android
       ```
   - **iOS (Requires a Mac computer):**
     - Open the `ios/<your-project-name>.xcodeproj` project in Xcode.
     - Select your device or simulator from the dropdown menu.
     - Click the "Run" button to launch the app.

3. **Hot reloading:**
   Changes to your JavaScript code will be automatically reflected in the running app without the need to manually restart.

**Running the App**

Follow the instructions in the "Development" section above to start the development server and launch the app on your Android device or iOS simulator.
